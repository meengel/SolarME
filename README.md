# SolarME

Query the solar position (azimuth and elevation angle) of the sun given longitudes and latitudes at a chosen timestamp.
We recommend using the `getME_sunpos` as a wrapper of `dnppy_solar`.

This package transfered the [dnppy.solar module by Jeff Ely](https://github.com/NASA-DEVELOP/dnppy/blob/master/dnppy/solar/solar.py) by NASA-DEVELOP to Python 3.
You can also check out the [post by John Clark Craig](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/python-sun-position-for-solar-energy-and-research-7a4ead801777) for further introduction to the topic.
